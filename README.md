jirarest2
=========

Another ruby gem for the REST2 interface of JIRA(tm)

This is still a very early alpha state and a lot of features are not yet implemented. Classes and their work might undergo major changes. (especially "Issue")

What works is the creation of issues with easy field types and watchers.
