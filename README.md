jirarest2
=========

Another ruby gem for the REST2 interface of JIRA(tm)

This is still a very early alpha state and a lot of features are not yet implemented. Classes and their work might undergo major changes. (especially "Issue")

What works?

  * creation of issues
  * add watchers to the issues
  * link new issues to issues that are already there
  * ruby script (create-issue.rb) that enables you to do this from the command line

Ruby1.9.1 is needed! Ruby1.8 will fail.
